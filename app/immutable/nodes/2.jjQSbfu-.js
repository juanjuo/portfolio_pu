			historical events of a Venezuelan military campaign of 1813 known as the Admirable Campaign. Which
			occurs right in the middle of the revolution for Venezuelan independence from the Spanish monarchy.
			The piece is constituted by 7 movements, each of which is linked to one important aspect of the
			revolution, and/or one important battle of the campaign, each movement explores both the underlying
			structure and happenings of the battle, and the socio-political context of that event. Please listen
			to the first movement (3 min.) as an excerpt for my application.</p> <p class="description svelte-1uha8ag"><a class="link svelte-1uha8ag" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va2jMdLojAUctrXoQ_l2I5Z4Jho3K0oX/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b class="svelte-1uha8ag">Score Here</b></a></p></div> <div class="video_container svelte-1uha8ag"><iframe class="video svelte-1uha8ag" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9ZQBw6s90A?si=JZ2RC1t7n7-efHI9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p class="description svelte-1uha8ag"><b class="svelte-1uha8ag">Maracas Etude -</b> The duration of the piece is 6 minutes. but the first 2 minutes are a good

			as part of the senior recital requirement for my undergraduate degree. In the work I explore a
			lot of themes that are personal to my life and my experience as a student in the United States,
			framed through the context of a letter I wrote to my father. This work also makes use of some of
			the technology I developed for my senior thesis for my second degree in Computer Science. It showcases
			some of the work I have been doing in the last year and the kind of art I am interested in doing
			going forward in my creative career. This piece feels like a draft to me. I don't intend it to
			be played by anybody else, or to be performed ever again. Though, I find it worth sharing, since
			it is a combination of raw materials deeply rooted in my experience as a performer/composer, as
			a student at Bard College, and emotional self. Please listen to the first 5 minutes as an excerpt
			for my application.</p> <p class="description svelte-1uha8ag"><a class="link svelte-1uha8ag" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va2jMdLojAUctrXoQ_l2I5Z4Jho3K0oX/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b class="svelte-1uha8ag">Score Here</b></a></p></div> <div class="svelte-1uha8ag"></div></main> <footer class="svelte-1uha8ag"></footer>`,1);function h(e){var a=r();i(4),o(e,a)}export{h as component};
